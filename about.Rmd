## Data and Software

I will upload here few datasets to do some analytical work using R. You can easily download and access those data to gain some exposures with various data management techniques and basic to advanvced statistical analysis using R.

### A little background about ![](R.png){width=4%}

R is a friendly and freely available programming software, that means you or your funders donâ€™t need to pay any money to use this. R can handle almost all kind of data with great visualizations. The built in programs in R is really convenient and there is a huge amount of R packages exist in public domain. Also there are lots of online materials to learn this very famous programming language (just google it). 

### ![](R.png){width=4%} installation process

The installation process of R and R Studio is very convenient. Please go through online to download [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) . Note that do install R studio only after installing R in your PC. Please choose the latest version of R and R Studio based on your PC and OS specification.

I am sharing here one youtube video upoaded by someone else which might help you to understand this software properly during your initial phase. Please watch the video till the last.

I am planning to cover different aspects of **Data Science** (starting from the basic) for free learning purpose (to access such web pages you don't need to pay anything; its completely free of cost; you will just need one internet connection to access those) which includes Data management, Data visualization and Statistical analysis interactively using R in subsequent courses. My primary motivation is to share maximum knowledge to whoever in need freely. I believe the web pages mentioned below will be good enough to shape early career students/researchers in the field of public health, biostatistics, statistics and social science. Happy Learning!!

I am very positive to continue developing such web pages on different type of statistical analysis and data handling techniques and these pages will be available freely. What are you thinking then? Of course! Start learning R today.

$N.B:$ Since I am a doctoral fellow like many of you I may do some mistakes in the above web pages. Please do correct me. If you have anything to say about course contents or any other issues, do write to me at *apurba@post.bgu.ac.il* \ref [apurba@post.bgu.ac.il].
