I am planning to cover different topics related to Data science for free learning purpose which includes Data management, Data visualization and Statistical analysis using R in subsequent courses. My primary motivation is to share maximum knowledge to whoever in need. I believe this below web pages will be good enough to shape early career researchers and job seekers in the field of Data Science and health care analytics. Happy Learning.

## ![](R.png){width=5%} Offspring 2019 web pages

The important part of these web pages that it would be completely free of cost and the vast data management and statistics domains have been covered by using some interactive examples. I am sharing here all the materials as follows:

- **1st Web page: ** In the 1st web page we are going to discuss basically to install R and R studio and performed some basic operations in ![](R.png){width=3.5%}. The reference web page you can find at https://appwick-hub.github.io/Offspring-2019/Offspring-2019-0.nb.html \ref [https://appwick-hub.github.io/Offspring-2019/Offspring-2019-0.nb.html]

- **2nd Web page: ** In the 2nd web page we are going to discuss mainly about sampling and random number generation. The reference web page you can find at https://appwick-hub.github.io/Offspring-2019/Offspring-2019-1.nb.html \ref [https://appwick-hub.github.io/Offspring-2019/Offspring-2019-1.nb.html]


- **3rd Web page: ** In the 3rd web page we are going to discuss on writing conditions, loops and functions. The reference web page you can find at https://appwick-hub.github.io/Offspring-2019/Offspring-2019-2.nb.html \ref [https://appwick-hub.github.io/Offspring-2019/Offspring-2019-2.nb.html]

$N.B:$ Since I am a doctoral fellow like many of you I may do some mistakes. Please do correct me. If you have anything to say about course contents or any other issues, do write to me at *apurba@post.bgu.ac.il* \ref [apurba@post.bgu.ac.il]. 

I am very positive to develop such web pages and these will be available freely further through which interested participants can shape themselves technically in the field of Public Health and Data Scienece using R and Python. I believe a huge quality crisis is there in the field of data science and public health in India, so by conducting such free courses, a huge number of candidates can be trained to get proper jobs in such fields.
