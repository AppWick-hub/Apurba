I am an Indian Citizen, currently pursuing my Doctoal Studies in Statistics and Epidemiology from the Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Israel. Currently, I am working on the genetics of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) by developing some machine learning algorithms using R and Python programming language.
