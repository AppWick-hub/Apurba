- Now, I am working with *Dr. Idan Menashe* on the genetics of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) by developing some machine learning algorithms using R and Python programming language.

- I received my Masters degree from the *Banaras Hindu University*, Varanasi, India in 2014-16.

- I did my M.Phil. in Biostatistics and Epidemiology from *International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)*, Mumbai, India in 2016-17.

- I worked as a summer trainee at the *National Institute of Medical Statistics (NIMS)*, New Delhi, India in 2015. 

- I also worked as a Data Analyst at the *Karnataka Health Promotion Trust*, Bangalore, India in 2017.

- The year 2018 was very productive academically in my life. I got funding from IUSSP to attend the conference and workshop conducted by **Population Association of America (PAA)** in Denver, USA. Few months later again I was selected and funded by UNFPA and Statistics Korea to attend the **5th KOSTAT summer training on R and STATA** software in South Korea. 

* At the Ben Gurion University, I have successfully completed some course courses till now like *Deep learning in computational biology using Python programming* and *Advanced epidemiological analysis using R programming*.
